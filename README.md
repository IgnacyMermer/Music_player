# Music_player

Fast project to learn audioplayers in Flutter and Dart. 
You can add new .mp3 file from your device storage and add image to this record. 
Audio and image files are save in sqlite. It's still under develop. Frontend of app is similar to Spotify/Deezer but it's not so beatiful(I'm sorry, but I haven't got ideas to make it prettier).
